# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using SQL
## Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL for a dataset related to company layoffs. The project is divided into two phases:
* Data Cleaning: Ensures the data is free from inconsistencies and inaccuracies.
* EDA: Extracts meaningful insights, identifies trends, and visualizes patterns in the cleaned data.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to:
* Clean the raw dataset to handle null values, duplicates, incorrect data types, and outliers.
* Analyze the cleaned dataset using SQL to uncover significant insights and trends related to company layoffs.

## Features
#### 1. Data Cleaning:
  * Handle missing or null values.
  * Remove duplicate entries.
  * Convert data types to match schema requirements.
  * Address outliers or inconsistencies.
#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
  * Basic statistical summaries of key columns.
  * Trend analysis on layoffs across different sectors and time periods.
  * Identification of key factors influencing layoffs.
  * Aggregation and grouping to identify patterns.

## Technologies Used
* SQL: For data cleaning, analysis, and querying.

## Project Structure
* DataCleaning.sql: Contains SQL queries used to clean the dataset.
* EDA.sql: Contains SQL queries used for exploratory data analysis.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/RVS2304/company-layoffs-analysis.git
2. Import the SQL scripts into your preferred SQL environment.
3. Execute the queries sequentially, starting with the data cleaning steps followed by the EDA queries.
